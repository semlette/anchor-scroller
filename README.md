## Configuration

You can pass the instance an options object to tweak it's behavior. The simplest options are `class` and `checkParent`.
```javascript
new AnchorScroller({
  "class": "scroll", // will make it only react on elements with a "scroll" class.
  checkParent: true // will make it check the parent element, if the clicked element didn't match the criteria.
});
```
